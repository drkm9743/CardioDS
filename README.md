# CardioDS (iOS 17.2.1 - 26.0.1)

![87](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29115431/193304861-3eb9f323-8d9e-46d9-a539-26565a655832.png)

> **⚠️ LiveContainer is NOT compatible.** CardioDS requires direct sideloading (SideStore or your preferred method).

## Features

- **Apple Wallet card customization** — Replace card background images directly from your photo library or the Files app
- **Card number editor** — Read and edit the last 4 digits displayed on your card (primaryAccountSuffix in pass.json), with automatic backup/restore
- **Metadata editor overlay** — Open a built-in JSON/text editor for `pass.json` and nearby `.strings` files, with per-file backup/restore
- **Auto kernproc offset resolution** — Downloads your device's kernelcache and resolves kernel offsets via XPF (XNU PatchFinder)
- **Integrated exploit engine** — DarkSword + sandbox escape, all built-in
- **Card management** — Backup, restore, rename cards with nicknames
- **My Cards** — Save and submit card designs to the community catalog with card name, issuer, and country metadata
- **Community Cards** — Browse and download 300+ card designs from a community-driven catalog, with remote updates that don't require a rebuild
- **Custom card submissions** — Submit your own card artwork directly from the app for review
- **Auto-approve pipeline** — Approved submissions are automatically added to the remote catalog via GitHub Actions
- **8-language localization** — English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Russian, Chinese (Simplified), Japanese

### Important Notes

- **iOS 26.0.1 / iOS 18.7.1 is the maximum scope** — anything more recent will likely never be compatible
- **iOS 18.7.2 / 18.7.3 / iOS 18.7.7** fixed DarkSword vulnerability, these versions are exceptions and it will never be supported.
- **Only tested on 18.6.2 arm64e A18 Pro** — if you are unable to make CardioDS work, report it through Discord or GitHub Issues
- **Sideload only** — LiveContainer, is NOT supported and never will be supported, don't ask for it.
- **Community Cards tab may load slowly** — The catalog contains hundreds of high-resolution card images; it may take a little while for the tab to load.
- **Submitted card image quality** — Cards submitted through the app are compressed to base64 JPEG to fit within GitHub's issue body limits (65,536 characters). This may noticeably reduce image quality compared to the original. For best results, submit images at card resolution (1536×969 or similar) with clean backgrounds, i will try to find a solution to this on future releases.

## How It Works

1. On first launch, CardioDS downloads the correct kernelcache for your device model and iOS version using `libgrabkernel2`
2. XPF (XNU PatchFinder) parses the kernelcache Mach-O to resolve `kernproc`, `rootvnode`, and process struct size
3. Offsets are cached in UserDefaults — no re-download needed unless you update iOS
4. The exploit engine uses the resolved offsets to gain kernel read/write access
5. Card artwork is written directly to `/var/mobile/Library/Passes/Cards`

## Setup

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drkm9743/CardioDS.git
cd CardioDS
```

### 2. Download XPF + libgrabkernel2 dylibs

```bash
mkdir -p card-test/lib
curl -L -o card-test/lib/libgrabkernel2.dylib \
  https://github.com/rooootdev/lara/raw/main/lara/lib/libgrabkernel2.dylib
curl -L -o card-test/lib/libxpf.dylib \
  https://github.com/rooootdev/lara/raw/main/lara/lib/libxpf.dylib
```

This downloads `libxpf.dylib` and `libgrabkernel2.dylib` from Lara's repository into `card-test/lib/`. If the downloads fail, grab them manually from [rooootdev/lara](https://github.com/rooootdev/lara/tree/main/lara/lib).

### 3. Xcode setup

1. Open `Cardio.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Drag `card-test/lib/` into the Xcode navigator
3. Select the **Cardio** target → **General** → **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**
4. Add both `libxpf.dylib` and `libgrabkernel2.dylib` → set **Embed & Sign**
5. In **Build Settings**:
   - **Library Search Paths**: add `$(SRCROOT)/card-test/lib`
   - **Header Search Paths**: add `$(SRCROOT)/card-test/kexploit`
6. Build and install via your preferred signing method

## Usage

1. Open CardioDS
2. The app auto-resolves kernel offsets on first run (or tap **Resolve Offsets** in the Exploit tab)
3. Tap **Run All** to run DarkSword + sandbox escape
4. Go to the **Cards** tab, tap a card, and pick a replacement image from your photo library or the Files app
5. Tap **Metadata** to edit `pass.json` or the card’s `.strings` files directly in-app
6. Tap the **Number** button to edit the last 4 digits shown on the card
7. Changes persist on disk; after reboot, run **Run All** again

## Troubleshooting

If the exploit fails to find your process or offset resolution fails:

1. Go to the **Exploit** tab and tap **Clear Kernel Cache**
2. Tap **Resolve Offsets** to re-download and re-parse the kernelcache
3. Then tap **Run All** again

Deleting and re-downloading the kernelcache fixes most issues. Try this before opening a GitHub issue.

The exploit execution could trigger reboots on your device, don't consider it as an issue until it happens like 10 times in a row.

Alternatively, exploit execution could take from seconds to minutes, be patient.

iOS 17.1.1 users reported the upload custom cards feature does nothing, fixing soon.

### Contributing Card Designs

Help build the community card catalog! You can submit designs directly from the app:

#### From My Cards (existing Apple Wallet cards)
1. Go to the **Cards** tab and apply the card background you'd like to share
2. Go to **My Cards** → tap **Backup All Current Cards** to save it
3. Find the card in your saved list and tap the green **Submit** button (↑)
4. Fill in the card name, issuer, and country in the submit sheet
5. The submission creates a GitHub Issue for review

#### Custom designs (from photo library)
1. Go to the **Community** tab → tap **Submit Custom Card Design**
2. Pick an image from your photo library
3. Enter the card name → submit
4. The submission is sent with `Issuer: Custom` and `Country: N/A`

#### How approvals work
1. A maintainer reviews the GitHub Issue
2. Adding the `approved` label triggers an automatic GitHub Action
3. The card image is decoded and saved to `community-cards/images/`
4. The card entry is appended to `community-cards/catalog.json`
5. The issue is closed with a confirmation comment
6. **The card appears in the Community tab automatically** — no app update needed

> **Note:** Submitted images are compressed to base64 JPEG (max ~44KB) to fit GitHub's 65,536-character issue body limit. This may reduce image quality. For best results, use clean card-resolution images (1536×969).

**Requirements for submissions:**
- Include the card name, issuer, and country
- One card per submission
- Submitted card images must not contain any personal information (card numbers are automatically stripped by Apple Wallet)
